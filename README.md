Georeferenced Sanborn Maps for downlown Los Angeles

Scanned maps from Los Angeles Public Library [add department] [add link]

This project is part of a larger project about Croatian Restaurants in early Los Angeles. But nothing published yet as the base is established. These Sanborn maps are an important part of the base.

I would not have been able to get anywhere without MaptimeLA. Maptime LA is a group that's open to all, where they teach people how to make all kinds of maps with free software and tools. They meet twice a month in downtown. https://maptimela.github.io/. Meetings:

Particular thanks to Omar, Machiko, and Regan at MaptimeLA.
