Some georeferenced images don't load in the right place. Using Add>Image Overlay. If I look at the Location tab, the coordinates that GE sees are obviously wrong. The images are TIFFs created with QGIS. I have checked on three Macs. Two running Yosemite and one El Capitan public beta. My two have lots of things installed, so I checked on my wife's Mac which has many fewer apps and no fiddling under the hood. An example of a tif which doesn't load correctly can be found here  https://github.com/cityhubla/sanborn_geotiff/tree/master/1888vol1 and screenshots of what I'm seeing can be seen here https://github.com/MtnBiker/Sanborn-GeoLocate-LA/blob/master/test/GE%20loading%20Omar%201888.png. Some of my GE preference settings can be seen here https://github.com/MtnBiker/Sanborn-GeoLocate-LA/blob/master/test/listgeo%20and%20GE%20settings.png. But I've tried this also on another Mac where the settings are almost certainly untouched and the problem is the same. Thank you for looking at this. Since I just had to repeat the steps to create the problem since I wasn't looking at it when I started this report, I think the image is loaded centered at wherever I am in GE.
